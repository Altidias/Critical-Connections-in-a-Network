# Critical-Connections-in-a-Network

I took two approaches both using Tarjan's Algorithim, the difference is one uses hashset which makes it slower but uses less memory, while the other one does not use hashset making it faster at the cost of more memory usage, with this one i also added some extra optimizations for memory usage to help compensate.
